               <!-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>-->
                <p> Privacy can mean many things from having the right to be left alone; to the right to have some control over how your personal information is properly collected, stored, used or released. We often think about privacy in different ways, for example:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Physical privacy - such as bag searching, use of DNA</li>
                   <li>Information privacy - the way in which government agencies or organisations handle personal information such as age, address, physical or mental health records</li>
                   <li>Freedom from excessive surveillance - the right to go about our daily lives without being surveyed or have all our actions caught on camera.</li>
               </ul>
                <p> The type of privacy we are more concerned with is information privacy. Whenever we do anything on the internet or on our phones all that data can be accessed by government agencies in many different ways. Different government agencies have different surveillance programs for example, it was only recently released that Edward Snowden, former NSA employee leaked information about a program called prism which collected personal information of the internet from companies such as Apple and Google.</p>
                <p>Agencies use a lot of different ways to collect information and one way is by accessing cookies of websites which a user has visited. A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer by a website&#39;s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie.</p>
                <p>Each cookie is unique to your web browser and it will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier, site name and numbers. It allows a website to remember your preferences for that particular website. Another way in which government agencies reduce our level of privacy is by accessing metadata. This is used so they can get around certain privacy laws as the metadata describes other data. </p>
                <p>For example, phones will contain metadata based on the numbers of calls made and received, the duration of the calls and the nearest cell tower the calls we carried out from. Another way that private information is collected is when these agencies engage in using MITM (Man in the Middle) which means that the agencies pretend to be the website you actually intended on using and collect any information you may enter before passing it on to the original website.</p>
