            <paragraph>When someone goes under a pseudonym and hides their true self to stay anonymous there is this uneasiness that surrounds them to other people. It is more of an ethical issue to hide yourself behind something just to express yourself or say things which may be taken wrongly. It is an intriguing issue as a lot of places in society one is required to show some form of identity when they do things such as flying on a plane or going clubbing.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The factor of staying anonymous promotes individuals to behaving badly and commiting crimes or scamming others behing a safety sheet so to speak. The meaning of ones words may not be fully recognised if an individual cannot tell who said those words. A persons view on a comment will change depending on who writes it (whether it be a friend or enemy) which means an anonymous individual can use this hidden cover as a strategy to achieve something which won't always be in good light.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This is the main issue with anonymity, a user can go under a guise and express themselves and be critical of others. But on the flip side you also know that some people will just have to do this because it is really the only way they can express themselves in a situation where they may not say something desirable.</paragraph>
