                <!--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>-->
                <p>The core concept of privacy and anonymity are quite different. The way privacy works is that a person who does this, is wanting to hide what they do and keep things to themselves regardless of the effect it has on third parties. In comparison to this, anonymity is the act of wanting third parties to see what you are doing however without actually revealing you are the one doing it.</p>
                <p> It can be seen as though both privacy and anonymity are vital to society even though they are different. As an example of research, there is a noticeable difference between the two: The difference between anonymity and confidentiality when protecting the rights of participants in research is how the information is handled. With anonymity, who they are is never known while with confidentiality their identities are kept within the confines of the research but are known.</p>
                <p> You could say that anonymity is an aspect of privacy as a whole but taking each separately, there is a significance difference between the two.</p>
