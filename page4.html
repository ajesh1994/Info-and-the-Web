                <div class="h1">What is Anonymity ?</div>
                <!--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>-->
                <p>A definition of Anonymity is when people want to remain unknown whilst using either the internet or other services such as chat rooms etc., to do this many people use an anonymity network. An anonymity network enables users to access the Web while blocking any tracking or tracing of their identity on the Internet. This type of online anonymity moves Internet traffic through a worldwide network of volunteer servers. Anonymity networks prevent traffic analysis and network surveillance or at least make it more difficult. It is becoming harder and harder for people to remain anonymous but with these anonymity networks and other pieces of software it is not impossible just yet.</p>
                <div class="h1">How to appear Anonymous ?</div>
                <p> Appearing anonymous can mean a few things. A compromised internet identity can make you an easy target for something such as identity theft or other illegal activity. One way you can achieve a good level of safety by being anonymous is by using TOR. This will allow you to funnel through your internet traffic by using a series of relays which will make it hard for other to get information out about you on the internet. You can also send anonymous emails by using secure email services that are provided online. </p>
                <p>What they do is encrypt the message you want to send using a key which is used to open the message. In general, social networking websites such as Facebook or more work related sites such as LinkedIn have privacy settings that allow you to change settings such as your name or restrict other users from contacting you. There are many other ways to stay anonymous on the web using stuff like proxies or VPN to access the web via a wall to block out your IP from being picked when browsing the internet.</p>
                <div class="h1">Problems with Anonymity</div>
                <p>When someone goes under a pseudonym and hides their true self to stay anonymous there is this uneasiness that surrounds them to other people. It is more of an ethical issue to hide yourself behind something just to express yourself or say things which may be taken wrongly. It is an intriguing issue as a lot of places in society one is required to show some form of identity when they do things such as flying on a plane or going clubbing.</p>
                <p>The factor of staying anonymous promotes individuals to behaving badly and committing crimes or scamming others behind a safety sheet so to speak. The meaning of ones words may not be fully recognised if an individual cannot tell who said those words. A person&#39;s view on a comment will change depending on who writes it (whether it be a friend or enemy) which means an anonymous individual can use this hidden cover as a strategy to achieve something which won't always be in good light.</p>
                <p>This is the main issue with anonymity, a user can go under a guise and express themselves and be critical of others. But on the flip side you also know that some people will just have to do this because it is really the only way they can express themselves in a situation where they may not say something desirable.</p>
